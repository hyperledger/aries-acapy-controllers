### Running in a Browser

_Note for Safari users: It is recommended to use Chrome for this demo. While the demo has been tested with Safari there are certain features that may not function properly in that browser. The demo has not been tested with other browsers so YMMV, depending on which browser you use._

In your browser, go to a docker playground service [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) (from Docker). To use the service you need an free account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

> NOTE: For reasons not quite clear to us, this demo does **NOT** run on the similar "Play with VON" service operated by the Government of British Columbia. We'll remove this comment if that changes.

On the [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) title screen, click "Start". On the next screen, click (in the left menu) "+Add a new instance". That will start up a terminal in your browser. Run the following commands to start the Web Demo:

```
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-acapy-controllers.git
cd aries-acapy-controllers/AliceFaberAcmeDemo
LEDGER_URL=http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io ./run_demo webstart

```

It may take a while for the all the agents and controllers to start up. You will also notice a number of ports appear once the demo is up. You will want to click the `9021`, `9031`, and `9041` ports to open up the Faber, Alice and Acme controllers in separate browser tabs, respectively. These are the equivalent to the `http://localhost:<port>` URLs referenced later in the demo.

_If you are interested in studying the APIs exposed by agents, click on the `8021`, `8031`, or `8041` ports to open up OpenAPI/Swagger UIs (API explorers) for Faber, Alice or Acme agents respectively._

### Running With Docker

This will be the easiest setup option.

### Running in the Cloud With AWS

_Note: These instructions apply when running the demo in a VPS or on your own server host and assumes you have already set up a cloud/server instance for running the demo._

Running the demo in an AWS instance is almnost exactly the same as running the demo locally with docker, however there is a caveat to getting the Alice controller to successfully connect to its agent.

Unlike Faber and Acme demo controllers, which are server-side applications (and are therefore hosted in the same network as their respective agents), Alice controller is an Angular application, that runs directly in your browser on your local machine. By default, controllers assume agents are running in the same network as the controllers (i.e `localhost`). However, `localhost` on your machine will not be the same as `localhost` on your AWS instance, therefore you have to explicitly build the Alice controller specifying the location where the Agent is hosted so it can connect and issue Agent API requests.

To do this you can provide an `ALICE_AGENT_HOST` environment variable when executing the `./run_demo` command as such:

```
$ LEDGER_URL=http://test.bcovrin.vonx.io ALICE_AGENT_HOST=<Your AWS Instance's Public DNS or IPv4> ./run_demo webstart
```

_Note:_ you may have to destroy any previously built Alice controller docker images so it will rebuild correctly with the correct agent context.

#### Opening Ports

Ensure that you have innbound and outbound rules enabled for the port range 9021-9041 on your AWS instance. Additionally you will need to enable inbound and outbound rules for port 8031 so that Alice controller can communicate with its agent.

### Running Locally

#### Prerequisites

##### VON Network

The demos require a Hyperledger Indy Node network. Is is recommended to use the [VON Network](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network), developed as a portable Indy Node Network implementation for local development. Instructions for setting up the `von-network` can be viewed [here](https://github.com/bcgov/von-network#running-the-network-locally).

**Note: running the demo locally will not work without a local VON Network running.**

##### ACA-Py Agents

Controllers are dependent on their respective cloud agents. Please follow instructions for [running agents locally](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/master/demo#running-locally) or [running agents in docker](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/master/demo#running-in-docker) as controllers wont do anything if agents are not running.

**Note: the controllers will not do anything without running their agents.**

#### Running Controllers

Please see the [Controller](./controllers/README.md) documentation for instructions on how to run controllers in your local environment.

### Demo Walkthrough

If you have made it this far, congratulations! 🎉 You are well on your way to becoming an Aries expert 💪.

You should have the controllers open in three different tabs of your browser:
- Faber at http://localhost:9021 (running with docker) or http://localhost:5001 (running locally)
- Alice at http://localhost:9031 (running with docker) or http://localhost:4200 (running locally)
- Acme at http://localhost:9041 (running with docker) or http://localhost:3000 (running locally)

**Scenario:**

Alice 👩 is a former student of Faber College ("Knowledge is Good") 🎓and wants to work for the coveted startup, Acme 🚀. The job Alice is looking to land requires a college diploma. Alice will connect with Faber to obtain her degree and then provide proof of her education to Acme in order to land her dream job.

**Steps:**

This part will take you through the specific steps of the Faber-Alice-Acme workflow. Faber, Alice and Acme are each tailored to perform specific functions, as you will see. Throughout every interaction keep in mind that the agents are doing all the work behind the scenes. The controllers are interacting through an API with the agents.

#### 1. Alice graduates from Faber College
_What an auspicious day! The many sleepless nights are over. Alice made it through her program of study and is on her way to a successful career. Faber offers all of their alumni to stay connected by extending an invitation code to all graduating students._

In the Faber browser tab, the home screen should display 4 options to choose from. The `Connections` page is where Faber can view, issue invitations and accept connections.

Navigate to the `New` tab where you will see a button `Create a New Invitation`. Upon clicking that you will see a JSON invitation object and an invitation URL (which is an encoded version of invitation object). Notice the different fields in the invitation object.

Copy either the invitation object or the URL. There is a handy copy button to the right of each of the fields. You will pass the invitation over to Alice.

_Note: The copy function may not work on Safari browsers. You will have to manually copy the the invitation object or URL if you plan to use Safari._

_Aside: If you navigate to the `Pending` tab you will see a new invitation card with a connection ID and a timestamp for when the invitation was created. This is a handy way to determine whether an invitee has accepted an invitation request or not._

#### 2. Alice accepts an invitation from Faber for her Degree

_Alice connects to her former college and requests a copy of her degree to keep in a digital wallet stored on her phone._

Open the Alice browser tab, and on the home screen you will see 3 options to choose from. The `Connections` page is where Alice will accept her invitation from Faber. Notice that Alice has the same connection tabs as Faber does.

Navigate to the `Accept` tab where you will see the option to either paste the invitation object or the invitation URL (depending on which one you copied). If you are successful the `Accept Invitation` button will activate. Press it.

Navigate over to the `Active` tab to see a connection to Faber. Similarly, Faber's  `Active` connections tab will show a connection to Alice.

#### 3. Faber issues a Degree credential to Alice

In the home screen of Faber you will see options for `Credential Schemas` and `Credential Definitions`. When the Faber agent was started, a degree schema and corresponding credential definition was issued to the VON Network. It is from these that Faber can construct a degree credential to deliver to Alice via their peer-to-peer (P2P) connection.

Navigate to the `Credential Schemas` page and select a schema from the select input. Notice the structure of the schema and the attributes including the `attrNames` list of credential attributes. Navigate over the the `Credential Definitions` page and select a credential definition from the drop down. Notice the difference in structure from the schema.

Navigate now to the `Credentials` page. This is where Faber can issue a credential to a connection. You will need to select a `Connection`, `Credential Schema` and a `Credential Definition` from the select inputs. In this case Alice is the only connection and a degree is the only credential that Faber can issue.

_Aside: Feel free to adjust the credential attributes but make sure they conform to valid JSON array structure otherwise the agent will fail to issue the credential._

When you are ready to issue the credential to Alice press the `Send Credential` button.

Open the Alice browser tab. In the home screen you will see a `Credentials` option. If Alice successfully received the degree credential from Faber, you will see it here. Notice the different attributes displayed in the credential.

#### 4. Alice applies for a job at Acme
_Alice is super excited to apply for her job. She sends an invitation request to Acme._

See if you can follow the same approach above to connect Faber to Alice. In this case Alice will create a new invitation.

#### 5. Acme agrees to interview Alice
_Acme agrees to connect with Alice._

See if you can follow the same approach above to connect Faber to Alice. In this case, Acme will accept the invitation. Acme has all of the same options in its `Connection` page as Faber and Alice.

If you are successful Alice and Acme will have active connections with each other.

#### 6. Acme requests a proof of education from Alice
_Acme was floored by Alice's resume and interview. They just need her to show a proof of her education (for HR purposes) and they will offer her a job._

Open the Acme browser tab. In the home screen you will see a `Proof Requests` option. Navigate to the `Request Proof` tab. Acme can request a proof from any of their connections. Select the Alice connection. For the Credential Definition ID, you will need to open the Faber browser tab and navigate to the `Credential Definitions` page. Select the credential definition from the list you are interested in receiving a proof for. You will need to copy the `id` which will look something along the lines of

```
vDdXBfpoDSCwTHqwH83AZ:3:CL:138:default
```
_Note: yours will have different numbers and letters but should be structured the same._

Now navigate back to Acme's `Request Proof` page and paste the ID in the `Credential Definition ID` input. Press the `Request Proof` button.

In the `Proofs` page of Acme you will see a new proof request sent (Alice can correspondingly see all proofs requested in her `Proofs` page). If the credential was successfully verified you will see a checkmark appear in Acme's proof request, indicating that Alice did successfully prove her education from Faber.

_Note: You will have to refresh the screen to see the verified proof._

Congratulations! You have finished the Faber-Alice-Acme demo. This is a good chance to dive into the agents to understand what's going on behind the scenes of all of these interactions. Feel free to also browse through the controller code and see where the controllers handle requests and responses between themselves and the agents.

### Note to Developers

Each controller used in the demo is built with a different web framework, which is intended to further demonstrate the versatility of agents. Controllers can be built using any web or mobile framework/technology of your choosing.

If you are interested in studying/extending the [Faber](./controllers/faber-controller/README.md), [Alice](./controllers/alice-controller/README.md) or [Acme](./controllers/acme-controller/README.md) controller code bases, each controller contains documentation with specific implementation details and how-tos for setting up development and debugging environments.
